Each folder has a .config (.cfg?) 

.config details 2 elements:
- layer
- exclusive


ps script has a hashmap:
- Key = int (layer)
- Val = List<String>
	where String is the abs. path to the resource folder.

Behavior:
- will list folders in current dir
- - Users navigate by selecting from that list (eg, "1" to go to the first), 0 to go back
